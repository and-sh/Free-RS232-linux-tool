# Free-RS232-linux-tool
This is the copy of

But I rewrite a little a code. Now you do not need to install anything. Just download the code and run app.py
python3 app.py
or run app.py from IDLE

The code contains error - it can not correctly determine the name of usb adapter.
You should write correct name here.
